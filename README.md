## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Show help information
chait --help

# Display the current version
chait --version or chait -v

# Interactively select a provider
chait --provider or chait -p

# Start interactive chat mode (default)
chait
```

### Quick Query Mode
Use `-n` (or `--no-interaction`) flag to get quick answers without entering interactive mode:

```bash
# Single question
chait -n "Your question here"

# Multiple arguments
chait -n "Tell me about" "the history of" "AI"
```

### Piped Input
Chait supports receiving input from pipes, which is useful for processing command outputs or file contents:

```bash
# Process command output with AI
ls -la | chait -n "Explain what these files are"

# Get AI explanation of a code file
cat main.go | chait -n "Explain this code"

# Analyze log files
grep ERROR app.log | chait -n "What might be causing these errors?"
```

#### Piped Input with Interactive Mode
When using piped input without the `-n` flag, chait will process the input and then enter interactive mode, allowing for follow-up questions:

```bash
# Process command output and enter interactive mode for follow-up questions
ls -la | chait

# Analyze a file and have a conversation about it
cat config.json | chait

# Review git changes and discuss them interactively
git diff | chait
```

### Interactive Mode Commands

```bash
# Show help information
:help or :h

# Start a new conversation
:clear or :c

# Switch between available models for the current provider
:model

# Set the temperature parameter
:temperature or :temp

# Configure or switch provider
:provider

# Exit interactive mode
:quit or :q
```
